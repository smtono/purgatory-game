Introduction
Rosalind (Unfamiliar Voice): Hey are you there?
Augustus: I am/Who are you?/St-stay away!
Rosalind: Oh good you're awake!/Woah, calm down, I'm not here to hurt you.

Augustus: Where am I?/.../How did I get here??
Rosalind: Uh... I'm not really sure/Nothing to say? That's okay, I'm not really sure where to begin./I have no idea, I just found you here.
Augustus: What?
Rosalind: I just got here too, I'm not sure what's going on... That's kind of why I was waiting for you to wake up.
Rosalind: Where ever this is, it's not very welcoming.
Augustus: ...
Rosalind: I think we should look around, what do you think?
Augustus: I think we should./I'm okay here./No way!
Rosalind: Great! Let's go./It'll be a lot better if we explored together, come on!/You're coming with me! I'm gonna die if I go by myself!\
